## Step 2: Dart classes

In this step, you create your first classes and run tests on it.

**Note**: Throughout this code lab, continue to edit the files in `s1_basics`.
You can use the files in the other `samples` subdirectories to compare to your code
or to recover if you get off track.

_**Keywords**: classes, tests_

### Problems?
Check your code against the files in [s2_binding](../samples/s2_binding).

TODO: remove
Don't worry about differences in package names.
Your files should contain the string `s1_basics`
wherever the files in s2_binding contain `s2_binding`.

For example, your `pubspec.yaml` should contain `name: s1_basics`,
while [s2_binding/pubspec.yaml](../samples/s2_binding/pubspec.yaml)
contains `name: s2_binding`.
Similarly, your `web/main.dart` should contain
`library s1_basics.main`,
while [s2_binding/web/main.dart](../samples/s2_binding/web/main.dart)
contains `library s2_binding.main`.
